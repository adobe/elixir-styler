  A Style takes AST and returns a transformed version of that AST.

  Because these transformations involve traversing trees (the "T" in "AST"), we wrap the AST in a structure
  called a Zipper to facilitate walking the trees.

  `run` will be used with `Zipper.traverse_while/3`, meaning it will be executed on every node of the AST.

  You can skip traversing parts of the tree by returning a Zipper that's further along in the traversal, for example
  by calling `Zipper.skip(zipper)` to skip an entire subtree you know is of no interest to your Style.
