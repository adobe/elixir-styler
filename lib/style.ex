  "Fixes" the line numbers of nodes who have had their orders changed via sorting or other methods.
  This "fix" siply ensures that comments don't get wrecked as part of us moving AST nodes willy-nilly.

  The fix is rather naive, and simply enforces the following property on the code:
  A given node must have a line number less than the following node.
  Et voila! Comments behave much better.

  ## In Detail

  For example, given document

    1: defmodule ...
    2: alias B
    3: # this is foo
    4: def foo ...
    5: alias A

  Sorting aliases the ast node for  would put `alias A` (line 5) before `alias B` (line 2).

    1: defmodule ...
    5: alias A
    2: alias B
    3: # this is foo
    4: def foo ...

  Elixir's document algebra would then encounter `line: 5` and immediately dump all comments with `line <= 5`,
  meaning after running through the formatter we'd end up with

    1: defmodule
    2: # hi
    3: # this is foo
    4: alias A
    5: alias B
    6:
    7: def foo ...

  This function fixes that by seeing that `alias A` has a higher line number than its following sibling `alias B` and so
  updates `alias A`'s line to be preceding `alias B`'s line.

  Running the results of this function through the formatter now no longer dumps the comments prematurely

    1: defmodule ...
    2: alias A
    3: alias B
    4: # this is foo
    5: def foo ...
