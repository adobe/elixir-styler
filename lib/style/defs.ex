defmodule Styler.Style.Defs do
  @moduledoc """
  Styles function heads so that they're as small as possible.

  The goal is that a function head fits on a single line.

  This isn't a Credo issue, and the formatter is fine with either approach. But Styler has opinions!

  Ex:

  This long declaration

      def foo(%{
        bar: baz
      }) do
        ...
      end

  Becomes

      def foo(%{bar: baz}) do
        ...
      end
