defmodule Styler.Style.Configs do
  @moduledoc """
  Orders `Config.config/2,3` stanzas in configuration files.

  - ordering is done only within immediate-sibling config statements
  - assignments are moved above the configuration blocks
  - any non `config/2,3` or assignment (`=/2`) calls mark the end of a sorting block.
    this is support having conditional blocks (`if/case/cond`) and `import_config` stanzas between blocks

  ### Breakages

  If you configure the same values multiple times, Styler may swap their orders

  **Before**

    line 04: config :foo, bar: :zab
    line 40: config :foo, bar: :baz

    # Application.fetch_env!(:foo)[:bar] => :baz

  **After**

    line 04: config :foo, bar: :baz
    line 05: config :foo, bar: :zab

    # Application.fetch_env!(:foo)[:bar] => :zab

  **Fix**

  The reason Styler sorts configuration is to help you noticed these duplicated configuration stanzas.
  Delete the duplicative/erroneous stanza and life will be good.
