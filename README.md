# Styler

Styler is an Elixir formatter plugin that's combination of `mix format` and `mix credo`, except instead of telling
you what's wrong, it just rewrites the code for you to fit its style rules.

You can learn more about the history, purpose and implementation of Styler from our talk: [Styler: Elixir Style-Guide Enforcer @ GigCity Elixir 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pF8Hl5EuD4)

## Features

- auto-fixes [many credo rules](docs/credo.md), meaning you can turn them off to speed credo up
- [keeping a strict module layout](docs/module_directives.md#directive-organization)
- alphabetizing module directives
- [extracting repeated aliases](docs/moduledirectives.md#alias-lifting)
- piping and unpiping function calls based on the number of functons
- optimizing standard library calls (`a |> Enum.map(m) |> Enum.into(Map.new)` => `Map.new(a, m)`)
- using sigils for strings with many escaped quotes `\"`
- ... and so many other things.

## Who is Styler for?

Styler was designed for a large team (40+ engineers) working in a single codebase. It helps remove fiddly code review comments and removes failed linter CI slowdowns, helping teams get things done faster. Teams in similar situations might appreciate Styler.

Its automations are also extremely valuable for taming legacy elixir codebases or just refactoring in general. Some of its rewrites have inspired code actions in elixir language servers.

Conversely, Styler probably _isn't_ a good match for:

- libraries
- experimental, macro-heavy codebases
- small teams that don't want to think about code standards

## Installation

Add `:styler` as a dependency to your project's `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:styler, "~> 1.0.0-rc.0", only: [:dev, :test], runtime: false},
  ]
end
```

Then add `Styler` as a plugin to your `.formatter.exs` file

```elixir
[
  plugins: [Styler]
]
```

And that's it! Now when you run `mix format` you'll also get the benefits of Styler's Stylish Stylings.

**Speed**: Expect the first run to take some time as `Styler` rewrites violations of styles and bottlenecks on disk I/O. Subsequent formats formats won't take noticeably more time.

### Configuration

Styler can be configured in your `.formatter.exs` file

```elixir
[
  plugins: [Styler],
  styler: [
    alias_lifting_exclude: [...]
  ]
]
```

Styler's only current configuration option is `:alias_lifting_exclude`, which accepts a list of atoms to _not_ lift. See the [Module Directive documentation](docs/module_directives.md#alias-lifting) for more.

#### No Credo-Style Enable/Disable

Styler [will not add configuration](https://github.com/adobe/elixir-styler/pull/127#issuecomment-1912242143) for ad-hoc enabling/disabling of rewrites. Sorry! Its implementation simply does not support that approach. There are however many forks out there that have attempted this; please explore the [Github forks tab](https://github.com/adobe/elixir-styler/forks) to see if there's a project that suits your needs or that you can draw inspiration from.

Ultimately Styler is @adobe's internal tool that we're happy to share with the world. We're delighted if you like it as is, and just as excited if it's a starting point for you to make something even better for yourself.

## !Styler can change the behaviour of your program!

The best example of the way in which Styler changes the meaning of your code is the following rewrite:
```elixir
# Before: this case statement...
case foo do
  true -> :ok
  false -> :error
end

# After: ... is rewritten by Styler to be an if statement!.
if foo do
  :ok
else
  :error
end
```

These programs are not semantically equivalent. The former would raise if `foo` returned any value other than `true` or `false`, while the latter blissfully completes.

However, Styler is about _style_, and the `if` statement is (in our opinion) of much better style. If the exception behaviour was intentional on the code author's part, they should have written the program like this:

```elixir
case foo do
  true -> :ok
  false -> :error
  other -> raise "expected `true` or `false`, got: #{inspect other}"
end
```

Also good style! But Styler assumes that most of the time people just meant the `if` equivalent of the code, and so makes that change. If issues like this bother you, Styler probably isn't the tool you're looking for.

## Thanks & Inspiration

### [Sourceror](https://github.com/doorgan/sourceror/)

Styler's first incarnation was as one-off scripts to rewrite an internal codebase to allow Credo rules to be turned on.

These rewrites were entirely powered by the terrific `Sourceror` library.

While `Styler` no longer relies on `Sourceror`, we're grateful for its author's help with those scripts, the inspiration
Sourceror provided in showing us what was possible, and the changes to the Elixir AST APIs that it drove.

Styler's [AST-Zipper](`m:Styler.Zipper`) implementation in this project was forked from Sourceror. Zipper has been a crucial
part of our ability to ergonomically zip around (heh) Elixir AST.

### [Credo](https://github.com/rrrene/credo/)

We never would've bothered trying to rewrite our codebase if we didn't have Credo rules we wanted to apply.

Credo's tests and implementations were referenced for implementing Styles that took the work the rest of the way.

Thanks to Credo & the Elixir community at large for coalescing around many of these Elixir style credos.
